# SpaceSoccer
this is a CCOMP 1's final proyect. You likely have played this game at any time. This game is like soccer but with only one player on each team. In the real world, players and ball are plastic circles. When the game start, the air (that is expulsed around all the table of the game) allow ball roll quickly.


# Challenges
1.- The first challenge was understanding "Cocos2dx" which is a game engine that provide you write on c++, but with difficulty of understanding all its code.\n
2.- Until sunday 25 it was impossible create a class.... finally, a litle post said, copy a paste files .h and .cpp in the same file that they are contained (obviously change name). It was work!
3.- I didn't know how use macros inside class, functions, etc. It was the first time that I use macros inside my code. Very interesting!
4.- Despite the framework has a lot of libraries and it seem easy to use, and probably I am not going to learn about hardcode. Understand the perspective of cocos's creators was a challenge and I learned full about how do huge codes with order and well practices of coding.
5.- Add. You can not code yours own classes without understand and know how cocos work. !You can likely find error of the other world!
